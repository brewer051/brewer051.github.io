Simply put, because I already should have. 

I got my first computer when I was 6 years old and computer hard/software has been a part of my life since. From the early days of my old DOS machine, to Android powered Chromebooks, technology has always been a hobby, a crutch and major influence on my life. Often times when I was younger I found myself using a computer as an escape from more unfortunate circumstances, and through these habits I developed a natural curiosity about how these machines work, and more importantly, how the programs within them work. My first experience with code was through modifying and modding game files to create general havoc for the games I was playing. Then from there, I moved on to modifying system files to make tweaks to my OS, (little more high stakes). From there it continued upward with the more access I had to various other devices and OS. 

Fast forward to my collegiate studies; I didn't have an IT/software curriculum available (and if I did, admittedly I would have shyed away). I feared that I would burn out and no longer find the joy in the tech and software that I love so much. Rookie move. I have went through a few jobs since graduating, still maintaining my love for code, tech and software, and now find myself working in the digital world, but in an analytical role. This suits much of my personality, but leaves me wanting as I don't get to apply myself to trial and error while building novel products from scratch. 

Slight fast forward, I have started Flatiron School because it is appallingly obvious that I should have been doing what I have used as an escape and hobby for all these years despite my fear of burn out. I am not one for cliches, but in my experience (Flatiron and my life) my most frustrating day tinkering with code and languages is far more interesting than the best day of analytics. 

This is why it is my hope that I can keep my discpline, maintain a high motivation and get through the Flatiron program in one piece so that I can finally come full circle with my ever ambitious hopes of being a software/full-stack developer.
